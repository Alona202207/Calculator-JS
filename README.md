
## Overview
Simple Calculator JS

This calculator has a dark theme with comfortoble button

## My process
 The first step was to find a calculator design. This code focuses only on the JavaScript logic employed to make the calculator work.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

I decided to reduce the number of characters after the period in the result and used this code for that:

if(this.id=="="){
					var result=eval(history).toFixed(2);
					printOutput(result);
					printHistory("");


### Useful resources
For the design I used an example from this resource:
